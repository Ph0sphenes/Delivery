# Project Description

### Introduction

Health is a big concern for every human being. Especially, due to the current pandemic situation, people have had more worries about their conditions. The emergence of the Covid-19 virus has negatively affected not only the politics and economy field but at the same time, it has had an influence on social life as well. Taking into consideration all these recent situations, we want to create a mobile app where people can easily find a doctor and make an appointment at any time they want.

## Problems
• Loss of time in finding the right doctor 

• No trusted online appointment system

• Physical visit to make a doctor’s appointment

• Loss of time at the queue of the doctor’s chamber

• There is a possibility to forget about the upcoming consultations

• Medical documents are often lost

• Getting medical documents on paper takes a long time

• Existing apps not work correctly and have poor ratings

## Goals
• Quick & Easy system for appointment

• Make appointment at your suitable time

• Minimizing waiting time in doctor chamber

• Find appropriate type of specialist in short time

• Save medical documents at hand in electronic form

## Scope
 
• Registration (Hospitals, Doctors, Patients)
   
• Search specialists

• Make an appointment

• Payment within the app

• Get history of appointments and doctor’s prescriptions

• Map of all hospitals

## Implementation

We will create a **mobile android app** and **REST API**. We decided to create REST API so that in future we can easily implement an IOS app and Web app using this REST API.  
       For writing REST API we chose **GOlang** programming language. Go has the better scalability and performance. Also easily deployed. For mobile implementation we chose **Java**. As a database server we will use **MySQL**. Because it has a lot of great features, **scalability** (easily scales managing applications in any size environment. It can be used in large data centers to process high volumes of data), **availability** (can be configured in a variety of ways to ensure the availability of mission-critical applications), **security** (supports encryption and secure connections to enforce security and keep unauthorized users out of your databases. It also protects financial transactions by having them work as a coordinated unit where if every stage of the operation does not complete successfully, the transaction fails), **flexibility** (can run on almost any operating system and affords companies the ability to use it with their installed hardware environment).
